# Simple project setup

## Repo Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to provide a template for future projects that use industry standard methods for documentation, test, and code coverage.

## What's included?

This repo includes:
- An html file you can load in the browser
- An index.js file  where you can put your code
- The boiler plate to document index.js
- The boiler plate to test index.js
- The boiler plate to do coverage tests on index.js
- The settings to run the documentation, test, and coverage with github actions

Whenever you push to this repo, a branch called gh-pages will be created. You can then go to the repo's github.io site to read the documentation.
