# Simple project setup

## Repo Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to provide a template for future projects that use industry standard methods for documentation, test, and code coverage.

## What's included?

This repo includes:
- An html file you can load in the browser
- An index.js file  where you can put your code
- The boiler plate to document index.js
- The boiler plate to test index.js
- The boiler plate to do coverage tests on index.js
- The settings to run the documentation, test, and coverage with github actions

Whenever you push to this repo, a branch called gh-pages will be created. You can then go to the repo's github.io site to read the documentation.

Whenever you push to this repo, it will be tested.

Whenever you push to this repo, it's coverage results will be pushed to codecov.
